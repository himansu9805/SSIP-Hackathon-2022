## Problem Statement

**Online appointment booking system for getting government documents.**

## Abstract

Jan Seva Kendra provides e-government services in various parts of India. These kinds of offices provide various services like issuance of certificates, licenses and so on. But the problem is that people have to wait for hours to receive their documents. This causes a lot of inconvenience to common people as well as Jan Seva Kendra staff. One way to solve this kind of problem is to use **Online Appointment Booking System**. Online Booking Systems are one of the most popular ways of prebooking any service online now-a-days. Various government departments like _Ministry of Road Transport and Highways_ use online appointment systems for various exams for related vehicles. By the using this kind of system, it will be very much beneficial for both people and staff as there will be only limited amount of people, who have an appointment, at the Jan Seva Kendra and people can easily select the slot of their convenience and visit the _Kendra_ accordingly.
